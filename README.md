# _"BEEP BOOP" - End of Week Three project_

#### _Practice using loops and branching in javascript and jQuery_

#### By _**Chris Quattrocchi**_

## Description

_End of Week Three project. The point is to use looping and branching in javascript to display all numbers leading up to an input. If the number is divisible by three, the input should return "I'm sorry Dave.". On the way up to the input number, numbers containing 0 or 1 should display Boop or Beep respectively. Output should be stored on page, instead of written over on resubmit.

## Specifications
-The steps I attempted to follow are as follows:

register a number, and display it in console

register a number, display it on page

register a number, display it on the page

display all numbers leading up to input number

if number is divisible by three with no remainder, display "I'm sorry Dave"

if number 0 appears, replace it with Boop

if number 1 appears, replace it with Beep

if number contains 0, replace with Boop

if number contains 1, replace with Beep

Prevent display from resetting upon clicking submit

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _clone repository_
* _extract zip file_
* _open index.html in a web browser compatible with jQuery 3.2.1_


## Known Bugs

_Currently just replaces the digit 0 or 1 with beep or boop, not the whole number. Example: 12 return BEEP2, not BEEP. Also, the Beep comparison must be compared against a string._
