# _"BEEP BOOP" - End of Week Three project_

#### _Practice using loops and branching in javascript and jQuery_

#### By _**Chris Quattrocchi**_

## Description

_End of Week Three project. The point is to use looping and branching in javascript to display all numbers leading up to an input. If the number is divisible by three, the input should return "I'm sorry Dave.". On the way up to the input number, numbers containing 0 or 1 should display Boop or Beep respectively. Output should be stored on page, instead of written over on resubmit.

## Specifications
-input   output
 0      ["Boop!"]
 1      ["Boop!","Beep!"]    
 2      ["Boop!","Beep!",2]
 3      ["Boop!","Beep!",2,"I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that."]
 4      ["Boop!","Beep!",2,"I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that.",4]
 10     ["Boop!","Beep!",2,"I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that.",4,5,"I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that.",7,8,"I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that.","Boop!"]
